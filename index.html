      <br> <b> 2) HTML</b>
      <p> HTML is the "heart of the web" and is the text content that makes up a webpage. HTML is the language that arranges the
        <br> content found on a webpage, it allows for the webpage to reference other content on the website and allows for the website to
        <br> have links to other pages.</p>
      <p>HTML is largely composed of elements i.e.
        <.name.>content
          <./name.>. An element is composed of a opening and closing
            <br> elements that tells the computer what to do with the content found in between the elements.</p>
      <p> HTML elements are can be split into two subtypes, a) inline elements and b) block elements. Inline elements will display content
        <br>within the same line if space is avalible, while block elements segregate content into its own box and into its own line.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>3)URLs</b>
        <br>
        <br> Urls are unique specifiers of the location of a webpage found within a computer network. Links contain URLs to other <a href="www.google.com">websites</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> 4) HTTPs </b><br>
        <br> When the end user requests a webpage through their internet browser, the request is sent as <em> HyperText Transfer Protocol</em> to the server.
        <br>The server then retrieves the desired document and sends it to the browser in HTML format.
